<font color='#808080' size='3'> After years searching for a suitable Windows text editor, we didn't find any of them to satisfy our needs, so we wrote our own.<font />

<font color='#000000' size='3'> ConTEXT is an advanced programmers' editor originally written by Eden Kirin over a decade ago and released as  freeware.  The editor quickly became popular as it was the arguably most powerful freeware editor for the Windows platform. Eden's work and interests changed and he neglected updating the program for several years.  In 2008, recognizing he no longer had time for ConTEXT, Eden sold ConTEXT to its current owner who has decided to open source the still widely popular editor.  The ConTEXT community plans on improving and modernizing ConTEXT to better compete with today's best freeware programmers' editors. <font />
